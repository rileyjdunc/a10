# DATA 730 assignment #11 repository

> :warning: **Do not clone this repository directly.**
> Use the 🍴 fork link on the assignment page in Canvas, then work in your own copy.

Full step by step instructions, including how to submit, are on Canvas. See the
**📋 Working on assignments** page in the Toolbox module of our course.

## Quick version

1. Fork this repository from the link on the Canvas assignment page.
2. From **your** copy on GitHub, click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.
   The first launch takes a minute or two while it downloads the course environment.
3. Once the codespace opens in VS Code, click the **Ports** tab in the bottom panel, then
   the globe icon next to **JupyterLab**. JupyterLab opens in a new browser tab. (If a
   JupyterLab tab already opened by itself, use that one.) Do not use GitHub's
   **Open in JupyterLab** menu item: it loads JupyterLab inside a frame, which most
   browsers block.
4. Open [`assignment11.ipynb`](assignment11.ipynb) and pick the **R (pixi)** kernel.
5. Commit and push your work back to your copy. **Pushing is what turns it in.**
6. Paste the URL of your copy of the repository into the Website URL box on the Canvas
   assignment page.

Everything you need (R, tidyverse, tidymodels, palmerpenguins, scikit-learn and the rest)
is already installed in the codespace. There is nothing to set up on your own machine.

## Working locally instead

If you would rather work on your own computer, install [pixi](https://pixi.sh) and run:

```bash
pixi install
pixi run -e lab jupyter lab
```

## Codespaces will stop on their own

A codespace stops after 30 minutes of inactivity. Saved files are still there when you
start it again, but **anything you have not committed and pushed stays inside that
codespace**, and GitHub deletes codespaces that go unused for 30 days. Push your work at
the end of every session.
